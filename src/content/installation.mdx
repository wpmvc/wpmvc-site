# Installation

Welcome to **WpMVC** — a modern WordPress plugin framework that brings simplicity, structure, and speed to plugin development. With expressive syntax and a rich set of tools, WpMVC helps developers build high-quality plugins effortlessly.

<Steps>

### Create a New Plugin

Start by scaffolding your plugin using Composer:

```sh
composer create-project wpmvc/wpmvc plugin-name
```

Replace `plugin-name` with your desired plugin folder name.

### Navigate to Your Plugin Directory

```sh
cd plugin-name
```

### Run the Setup Wizard

Configure your plugin details interactively:

```sh
php artisan app:setup
```

#### Setup Prompts Explained

When prompted:

* **Enter Plugin:**
  This is the display name of your plugin.
  *Example:* `Plugin Name`

* **Enter plugin namespace:**
  This is the PHP namespace used throughout your codebase.
  *Example:* `PluginName`

* **Enter plugin API namespace:**
  This is the namespace for your REST API endpoints.
