# Introduction to WpMVC

**WpMVC** is an expressive, elegant, and powerful MVC framework designed specifically for WordPress plugin development. It brings the best practices of modern PHP development—inspired by Laravel—to the WordPress ecosystem.

Whether you're building a simple utility or a complex SaaS-style plugin, WpMVC provides the architecture, tools, and components you need to build faster and maintain your code with ease.

## Why WpMVC?

WordPress development shouldn't feel outdated. WpMVC bridges the gap between traditional WordPress hooks and modern software engineering patterns.

- **🚀 Speed to Production**: Scaffold an entire plugin in seconds using the Artisan CLI.
- **🏗️ Structured Architecture**: Follows a clean MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.
- **💉 Dependency Injection**: Decouple your code with a powerful container-based DI system.
- **✨ Laravel-Like Syntax**: If you know Laravel, you'll feel right at home with our Routing and Database systems.
- **⚛️ Modern React Tools**: Build stunning admin interfaces with JSKit—our React component library tailored for WordPress.
